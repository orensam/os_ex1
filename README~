Running
-------

Running the tester creates a ./tmp directory at the location of the tester:

  ./tester.py <tar file>

If you want to change the files in ./tmp and test them again without tar'ing them, use:

  ./tester.py -t

You can compare actual numbers by running the school solution executable ./sol/measure

Important Notes
---------------

This is a specific version of the tester. If you are going to resubmit, know that some numbers
will be changed, and tests added. Also note that in resubmissions, your code will be reviewed
thoroughly and you can lose more points.

Also note that whenever an error is detected by the tester, it is only reduced after reviewing
the code, so you might see some errors that didn't actually appear in your grades.

If your changes to the code somehow affect these issues (i.e. make them worse), these points
MAY BE REDUCED in the resubmission grading, so be careful!
